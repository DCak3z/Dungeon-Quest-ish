# Dungeon-Quest-ish
in C++


A simple text-based adventure game.
by Garrett and Max Webb.

This is an early development, and in need of much improvement.
I am a computer science student and this is my first project on my own.

needs to be restructured for better efficiency.

if you have a constuctive idea, I am very open to changes.
Thank you for your contributions and considerations.
